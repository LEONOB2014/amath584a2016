We will cover much of parts I through V of 
Trefethen and Bau, 
`Numerical Linear Algebra <http://bookstore.siam.org/ot50/>`_,
along with some supplementary material.

Some major topics
------------------

* Review of basic linear algebra in finite dimensional spaces, including
  both :math:`R^n` and also function spaces.

* Linear independence, bases, norms, matrix factorization, etc.

* Orthogonality and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

* Least squares problems: QR factorizations, Gram-Schmidt, Householder
  transformations.

* Conditioning of problems and stability of algorithms.

* Linear systems of equations: Gaussian elimination and LU factorizations.

* The eigenvalue problem: the power method and QR algorithms, relation to SVD.

* Various applications of the above algorithms will also be considered.
