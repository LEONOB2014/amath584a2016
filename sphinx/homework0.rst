Due by 11:00pm PDT on Tuesday, October 4.

This assignment is not worth any points but is intended to make sure you are
set up for later assignments and to provide us with some information.

- First fill out this `survey
  <https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/rjl/312826>`_ to
  to tell us about your background, and to let us know what email
  account to use for setting up a shared Dropbox folder (shared only
  between you and the instructor and TA). 

- Then a Dropbox folder will be shared with you, which you will use to
  submit this and later homeworks.  See :ref:`dropbox`.

- The file `hw0.pdf <_static/hw0.pdf>`_ explains what else needs to be done.

- To do this, you will have to follow the instructions in :ref:`class_repos`
  to use Git to clone the class repository, in which you will find a directory
  `homeworks/hw0` containing the file `hw0.tex`.

- Create a folder `hw0` in your Dropbox folder and copy `hw0.tex` from the
  class repository to that directory.

- Modify that version of the file to add your name and netid, along with the
  `pdf` file created by running latex on it.
