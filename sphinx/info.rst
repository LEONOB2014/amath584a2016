Course Description
------------------

This course is an introductory graduate level course in numerical methods
designed to give engineering, mathematics, and science students the
expertise necessary to understand and use computational methods for solving
scientific problems. The emphasis is on methods for linear algebra problems
(direct methods for linear systems, linear least squares problems, and
algebraic eigenvalue problems). 

This course is the first in a series of
three numerical methods courses. Amath 585 treats boundary value problems
(ODEs and PDEs) and iterative methods for their numerical solution. Amath
586 treats initial value problems (ODEs), parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs and
methods for their numerical solution. This is a five (5) credit course.

Prerequisites
------------------

* Some Computing Programming (Matlab, Python, R, Fortran, or C)

* Linear Algebra (e.g. MATH 308, AMATH 352, or equivalent)


Computer Software
------------------

Please use either Matlab or Python.  Examples will be presented in both
languages in some cases.

See :ref:`software` for more about your options.


Textbook
--------

* Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau, III,
  `Numerical Linear Algebra <http://bookstore.siam.org/ot50/>`_,
  SIAM, 1997, ISBN-13: 978-0-898713-61-9.

Note that you can purchase it direct from `SIAM <http://www.siam.org>`_
with a substantial discount if you are a SIAM member, and that 
`student membership <http://www.siam.org/students/memberships.php>`_ is free!

See :ref:`biblio` for some other resources you might find useful.

Topics to be covered
--------------------

We will cover much of parts I through V of 
Trefethen and Bau, 
`Numerical Linear Algebra <http://bookstore.siam.org/ot50/>`_,
along with some supplementary material.  

In particular:

* Review of basic linear algebra in finite dimensional spaces, including
  both :math:`R^n` and also function spaces.

* Linear independence, bases, norms, matrix factorization, etc.

* Orthogonality and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

* Least squares problems: QR factorizations, Gram-Schmidt, Householder
  transformations.

* Conditioning of problems and stability of algorithms.

* Linear systems of equations: Gaussian elimination and LU factorizations.

* The eigenvalue problem: the power method and QR algorithms, relation to SVD.

* Various applications of the above algorithms will also be considered.


Grading
-------

Homework: 50%, midterm exam: 25%, final exam: 25%. 
There will be 5 homework assignments. 
See :ref:`homeworks` for more information and due dates.
