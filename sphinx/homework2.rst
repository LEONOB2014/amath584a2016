Homework 2
=============================================================

- `hw2.pdf <_static/hw2.pdf>`_

The homework is due by 11:00pm PDT on October 25, 2016.  You can turn it in
up to 24 hours late with a 10% reduction in credit.  

The latex file for this homework assignment is in the :ref:`class_repos` in the
directory `homeworks/hw2.tex`.  You are encouraged to use latex to do the
homework, in which case you might want to start with this file.  There are
some comments in the file indicating where in add your solutions.

If necessary you can hand write and scan parts of it, but try to use latex
more and more as the quarter goes on.

To submit, create a folder `$MY584/hw2` in the Dropbox folder that has been
created for you to submit homework, see :ref:`dropbox`.
Place any files you want us to look at in this folder, preferably a pdf file
but also perhaps an m-file or Jupyter notebook.  If you use Matlab Publish or
a notebook, you might also want to create a pdf from it.

For Problem 8, please also include a separate `.m` or `.py` file that
contains the Matlab or Python function `mgs`.
